# Read Controller Non-volatile Memory (e.g. SPI NOR Flash)

## Security-relevance

The capability for someone on the host to read non-volatile memory (NVM), such as SPI NOR flash, can aid in reverse engineering the Controller code on platforms where all or part of the firmware is stored in NVM as in [1][2].
